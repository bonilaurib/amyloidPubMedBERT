<p align="justify">
Advances in natural language models (NLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches now enable large-scale analysis of scientific publications, uncovering hidden patterns and facilitating data-driven insights. Here, is presented a two-dimensional mapping of the global **Amyloid research landscape**, utilizing the transformer-based large language model PubMedBERT, combined with t-SNE, to analyze abstracts from the PubMed database. This project provides a comprehensive visualization of the **Amyloid field**, capturing key trends such as the historical progression of amyloid research, the emergence of dominant subfields, the distribution of contributing authors and institutions, and the identification of latent research topics over time.
